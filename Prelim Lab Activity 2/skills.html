      <p class="profile-text">
       My goal as a web developer is to continuously grow my expertise in crafting responsive, user-friendly,
       and visually appealing interfaces that elevate the overall digital experience. I aim to master modern
       frontend technologies, strengthen my understanding of UI/UX principles, and stay updated with design trends
       that improve usability. I also strive to collaborate with creative and technical teams, contribute to impactful
       projects, and eventually build products that not only perform efficiently but also inspire users through intuitive
       design and smooth interaction.
